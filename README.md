What is the ridership revenue per borough?

  As we analyzed our MTA datasets from Feb 2022 to present, we were able to conclude that Manhattan has been the highest earner out of all the boroughs. 
  Along with the highest number of passengers, manhattan has been an economical front-runner for the MTA since 2022, bringing in over 3 billion dollars. 
  On the other hand, Staten Island can be seen contributing the least.
  
What is the average ridership revenue per borough? 

  Here we are looking to compute the average revenue for each borough based on the ridership data collected from 2022 - 24. 
  After looking at the information regarding the total number of riders and revenue over the specified time, we can now utilize our code and study this bar graph to  further understand and review  the average         revenue being generated by each borough.
  Once again, it is evident that Manhattan is the hot spot for MTA averaging  over a billion dollars in revenue.
